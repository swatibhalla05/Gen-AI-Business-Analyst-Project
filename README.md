Dataset Overview The dataset, titled "Applicant Details," comprises 29,999 entries and 13 variables, each capturing key aspects of the applicants' financial profiles and personal characteristics. The primary attributes include:

Applicant_ID: A unique identifier for each applicant. Annual_Income: The annual income of the applicant, measured in currency units. Applicant_Age: The age of the applicant. Work_Experience: The total number of years of professional experience the applicant has. Marital_Status: The marital status of the applicant, indicating whether they are single or married. House_Ownership: Indicates the type of housing the applicant occupies, such as owned or rented. Vehicle_Ownership (car): A binary indicator of whether the applicant owns a car. Occupation: The applicant's profession or job title. Residence_City and Residence_State: The city and state where the applicant resides. Years_in_Current_Employment: The number of years the applicant has been employed in their current job. Years_in_Current_Residence: The duration, in years, that the applicant has lived at their current residence. Loan_Default_Risk: A binary variable indicating the likelihood of the applicant defaulting on a loan.

Work Conducted: This File presents a thorough analysis of the "Applicant Details" dataset, incorporating several key stages of data processing, exploration, and advanced analytical techniques:

Data Preprocessing:

The initial steps involved cleaning the dataset by removing duplicate rows and handling missing values. Specifically, the notebook includes strategies such as dropping rows with missing data, filling in missing values with predefined values, and replacing specific data entries to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Data Visualization:

Various visualizations were created to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between the dataset's variables. These charts likely include histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts, which help to illustrate trends in applicant age, income distribution, occupation, and more. Hypothesis Testing:

The notebook includes hypothesis testing to statistically assess relationships between variables. This may involve tests such as t-tests or chi-square tests to explore differences in income across marital statuses or the impact of vehicle ownership on loan default risk. Predictive Modeling:

Advanced predictive models were developed to forecast the likelihood of loan defaults among applicants. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests might have been employed, leveraging the datasetâ€™s attributes to predict loan default risk. Interpretation and Insights:

The notebook concludes with interpretations of the visualizations and model results. Key insights drawn from the analysis would include identifying significant predictors of loan default, understanding demographic trends in financial stability, and providing data-driven recommendations for loan approval criteria.
